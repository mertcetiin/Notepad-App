# Notepad Application

This project is a simple Notepad application built using Vite.js. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete notes.

## Features

- Ability to add notes with a title and content.
- Capability to edit existing notes.
- Option to delete notes.
- User-friendly interface and easy-to-use.

## Project Development

The project is developed using the React library. I utilized React's state management to handle the notes. Additionally, I followed a component-based architecture to keep the application's components organized and maintainable.

For temporary data storage, I used JavaScript arrays and local storage. This ensures that your notes will persist even when you reload the page.

## How to Run

1. Clone the project to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/mertcetiin/Notepad-App.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd notepad-application`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the application: `npm run dev`

The application will run by default at http://localhost:5173. You can open this address in your browser to access the Notepad application.
